# How to use Bluebox

Read these instructions before handling Blueboxes.

## Before the event

### Rent the Bluebox

See **[OResults/Organize](https://oresults.eu/organize)**.

### Charge the Bluebox

The **battery life** of the Bluebox is approximately **20 hours**, so it will last for two standard weekend stages on a single charge.

*The Blueboxes are charged using the micro USB connector located under the cover on the side of each unit. Use the charger provided in the rental set. In case you want to use your own charger, it must have a nominal output voltage of 5V.*

### Setup online controls

One Bluebox is capable of receiving punch records from up to 8 SI-SRR stations (see **[How to set up a radio control](../tutorials/radio-control.md)**)

## On the day of the event

Turn on the Bluebox and simply snap it onto the stand with the SI station already snapped onto the top of the Bluebox. Then just check the Bluebox assignment for your event (see **[How to manage events](../tutorials/setup.md)**)

:::caution
If you choose not to place the Bluebox on the same rack as the control, make sure the Bluebox is placed at approximately the same height as the SI station at a **maximum distance of 2 meters** to ensure reliable detection of punch records.
