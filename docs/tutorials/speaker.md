:::info
Don't be alarmed that some rows have more columns than others. The number of columns is always class specific.
:::

## Features

### Filter

- **Display limit:** how many latest punch records is shown in the table
- **Class:** filter classes which you see in the table
- **Controls:** filter which controls you see in the table
- **Search by name or club:** full-text search across results

### Table

Each row of the table belongs to one competitor. The most recent punch records are displayed in the first row.

The **first column** displays the **class** name.

The **second column** displays competitor's **name** and **club/team**.

The **following columns** contain the competitor's **split times**. The intermediate time columns are progressively filled in as the competitor goes through the radio controls.

> If a competitor visits new radio controls, his row is moved to the top of the table.

The **last column** contains the **clearance information** (`OK`, `Disqualified` and `Unread`).

> If a competitor appears in **first, second or third place** at any of the radio controls, **the split time is coloured** with corresponding colour as shown in the picture.

:::tip
You can easily filter the classes by clicking on the class name in the row of any competitor.
