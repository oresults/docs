# How Can I Get Online Controls at My Event?

This guide helps organizers decide how many Blueboxes are needed, how to arrange a rental, and what to do if they already have their own online controls.

## 🔢 How Many Online Controls You Need?

1. **Best practices for online controls**
   - Add around **3 online controls in the forest per major category** (e.g. M21E, W21E, or other featured classes).
   - **Online control at the finish prewarning (usually control 100)** for commentators and at **the finish** if you want to avoid waiting for the readout.
   - Arena passage controls or spectator loops benefit greatly from online coverage.
2. **Event examples**
   - Local/club event: **2–3 Blueboxes** (finish prewarning + forrest).
   - National event: **5–8 Blueboxes** (finish prewarning + 3 controls per elite category + finish).
   - International event: **10+ Blueboxes**, depending on number of featured classes, spectator areas and TV controls.

## 🛠️ Getting the Right Equipment for Online Controls

### 🏢 Renting Blueboxes

- You can rent Blueboxes directly from OResults.
- **Try before the event**: It's possible to borrow Blueboxes in advance of your competition, free of charge, to test them at a training or smaller event.
- **Event rental**: For your actual competition, rented devices are normally shipped to you in the **week before the event**.
- To request a rental, contact us via [**OResults.eu**](https://oresults.eu/online-controls) with:
  - Event name, date and location
  - Estimated number of online controls
  - Any special requirements (e.g. **SPORTident SRR stations if needed**)
- You'll receive confirmation with:
  - Number of Blueboxes provided
  - Delivery and return instructions (we ship and receive primarily via [**Zásilkovna**](https://www.zasilkovna.cz/) in all countries where it operates; for other countries, we will arrange alternatives)

:::note
If your event uses **non-SIAC cards**, you may also need **SPORTident SRR stations** to make online controls work. These can be rented **free of charge together with the Blueboxes** based on their availability— just mention this in your request. See [**Setup Radio Control guide**](radio-control) for details.

:::tip
**Order Blueboxes early** — rentals are subject to availability, especially during peak season.

#### 📦 Return Blueboxes

- Returning rented material is simple via [**Zásilkovna**](https://www.zasilkovna.cz/):
  - Use the return code you received with your rental.
  - Bring the box to any Zásilkovna location, provide the code, and they will handle the return for you.
- If Zásilkovna is not available in your country, please contact us for custom return instructions.

### 🔧 Using Your Own Online Controls

If you already have devices that can work as online controls, you have several options:

1. **📱 Using a phone with the Bluebox Mobile App**
   - Install the **Bluebox Mobile App**.
   - Register your devices in the **Admin → Devices** section.
   - You can then use the phone as an online control, just like a rented Bluebox.
2. **💻 Using other existing equipment**
   - First, check whether your device is already supported by **OResults** directly or through **integrated software** (e.g. OE12).
   - If supported, you should easily connect it and start sending live data.
3. **🆕 New or unsupported solutions**
   - If you have a new type of online control, or you're unsure if it can connect to OResults, don't hesitate to contact us.
   - We'll review the options and may be able to work out a solution together.

:::note
OResults is free to use today. In the future, there may be a small fee for connecting your own online controls — but if that happens, organizers will always be informed well in advance, so no surprises.

## ➡️ Next Steps

If you've arranged your online controls (either rented Blueboxes or your own devices), you can move on to the [**Organizers Cheatsheet**](organizers-cheatsheet) which covers everything to check before, during, and after the event for smooth organization.
