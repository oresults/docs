### Notes

* App connects to the SPORTident USB dongle automatically but make sure you accept all needed permissions (and check the "always" button) so the dongle can auto re-connect when the contact is loose.
* If you deny the app the location permissions, signal strength will not be sent to the OResults service and will be missing in the dashboard.
* App prevents the phone entering sleep mode. Do not leave the app running in the background if you are not using it, it will drain your battery. 
* **Device** screen shows incoming punches (green) and dongle connection status messages (yellow). **Punches** tab displays saved punches and their *send / not send yet* status.

:::caution
**Ensure the Internet connection**

Make sure that your device is connected to the Internet in the place of your radio control.

## On the day of the event
