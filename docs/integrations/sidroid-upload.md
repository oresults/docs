:::

### 5. Check out [OResults.eu](https://oresults.eu/)
- scan QR Code and follow how your buddies, rivals, clubmates or family are doing

:::tip
You can switch between event data and evets settings using the button in the upper left corner (you have to be logged in)
:::

## Advanced settings
### 1. More columns/radiocontrols
Additional columns/data can be added (will be filled in after the read-out) to the screen after importing courses and selecting radiocontrols (fake ones) in `Prepare` section in the event settings.

This selection:

results in (examples of different classes):
<img src="/img/oresults-event-data-columns01.png" />
<img src="/img/oresults-event-data-columns02.png" />

instead of basic:
<img src="/img/oresults-event-data-columns03.png" />

:::caution
Without imported courses it is not possible to select radio controls.
:::

### 2. Upload start list
Creating a start list with a mass start in an external program ([QuickEvent](https://github.com/Quick-Event/quickbox), [MeOS](https://www.melin.nu/meos/en/), [OE12](https://sportsoftware.de/orienteering/oe), ...) and then manually uploading it to OResults will allow you to view all the competitors who should start, so you can see who hasn't read-out yet.
