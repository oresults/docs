# QuickEvent Service

**[QuickEvent](https://github.com/Quick-Event/quickbox)** has a dedicated service that enables automatic uploading of start lists and results directly from QuickEvent to OResults.

## Setup

The service setup is located in the Services tab.

- **Export interval**: This is how often the official start list and results from QuickEvent are uploaded to OResults.
- **API key**: This key is unique to your event and can be found in the event settings.

:::danger
If you have multiple events in one day or over a weekend, remember to **update the API key in QuickEvent** for each event.
